# Matrix .NET SDK

This SDK provides a wrapper around the Client>Server API for the Matrix.org Specification.

It is not yet a *complete* implementation, but it is considered usable enough for bots and basic clients.

## How to Use

A nuget exists for this project at https://www.nuget.org/packages/MatrixSDK.dll/1.0.0

A (very barebones) examples is in the solution file, but you will almost certainly need more. 

## Documentation

Documentation is covered for the Client (and *some* of the API), however no online resources exist yet.

## Reporting Issues

Please report bugs/features/threats through the github issue tracker.

If you have a pressing issue, you can find me on matrix as [@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk)
